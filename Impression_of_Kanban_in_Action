This book Kanban in Action (I read Japanese translated version) was greate.

I iritated many times on my work. Because its like lots of things suddenly make an alert to me all the time.
Ajusting schedules is always difficult with no concreate reasons.
I always feel without someones's help, but I have to have some responsibilities.
Working is like not cooperationg, but competing.
Kanban method maybe help to the way of my thinking.

I always have plural tasks. I thought I should have several to finish many tasaks. I've believed thats good way.
But this book tells me thats the reason my task speed is slow.

this book help me to do single thing.
Now I can concentrate to only one task.

For example.
When I feel to want to go to booksrore before finishing currend one, I can stop and bring me back to reading.
I write my tasks to KanbanFlow, ZenHub(GitHub) so I don't miss the things I truly plannned.
these 2 things are so important thing for me.
