This book Kanban in Action (I read Japanese translated version) was greate.

I iritated many times on my work. Because its like lots of things suddenly make an alert to me all the time.
Ajusting schedules is always difficult with no concreate reasons.
I always feel without someones's help, but I have to have some responsibilities.
Working is like not cooperationg, but competing.
Kanban method maybe help to the way of my thinking.

I always have plural tasks. I thought I should have several to finish many tasaks. I've believed thats good way.
But this book tells me thats the reason my task speed is slow.
